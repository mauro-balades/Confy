 * @brief The main class to manage the configuration root interface.
 *
 * This class is the main class to manage the configuration root interface.
 * Root interfaces are used to create a schema for the configuration.
 * If the parser finds a key that is not in the schema, it will throw an exception.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * // Create a root interface
 * auto root = confy::RootInterface::create({
 *     {"key1", confy::Type::String},
 * });
